<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schaumburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>, announced plans to eventually curtail emissions of chlorofluorocarbons, or Cfcs.
The maker of electronic equipment and semiconductor chips joins a growing number of major companies seeking to reduce or eliminate use of the common but environmentally harmful compound.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> said it wants to eliminate CFC emissions at its plants world-wide by the end of 1992. A spokesman couldn't immediately say how many pounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cfcs Motorola</ENAMEX> plants currently emit every year.
Cfcs are widely used in the electronics and other industries as solvents, coolants and fire suppressants. But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth's ozone layer, and a 1986 international treaty calls for consumption and production of the compounds to be halved from 1986 levels by 1998.
