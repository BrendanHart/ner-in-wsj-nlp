Foreign investment in equity projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> between January and August dropped 40% from the same period last year to $593 million, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> said.
The tally on an approval basis involved 311 projects, and compared with the $986 million for 368 projects in the January-August period a year earlier.
The sharp drop was attributed partly to a deterioration in the local investment environment from widespread labor disputes and steep wage boosts, which <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> experienced in the past two years.
Officials said another factor was that there were no big projects this year. In the same period last year, they said, two big hotel projects, together valued at $340 million, were approved.
