It is an astounding paradox that the American people return a congressional slate almost totally unchanged from election to election, while clamoring for ``renewal'' and a break with the past when choosing a president. Almost all presidential candidates -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>, even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kennedy</ENAMEX> -- run against ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'' or the ``system,'' codewords for an establishment thought to be out of touch with the real <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>. Each new campaign is proclaimed a crusade to liberate the land from the foolish policies of the predecessor president. It is as if the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> is in perpetual revolution.

A little hypocrisy is not always a bad thing in diplomacy; but a hypocrite is not a cynic. A cynic knows that what he says publicly about his motives is false; a hypocrite, in contrast, is not conscious of the discrepancy between what he says and what he wants. By and large, Americans are not cynical, so when we are hypocritical about our foreign-policy objectives, we tend to delude ourselves.
