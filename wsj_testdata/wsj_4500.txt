Mountain West Savings Bank said its board rejected as ``inadequate'' a $15.25-a-share, $25 million unsolicited offer for all of its shares outstanding. The company has declined to name the suitor.
A spokesman said the board's rejection stemmed, in part, from several terms of the offer that it believes ``aren't in the best interests'' of the company or its shareholders. He declined to elaborate. Mountain West has assets of $325.7 million and operates 10 branches and three loan-production offices in Idaho.
